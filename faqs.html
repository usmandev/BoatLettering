                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Next to selecting a winning name, determining where you want to install the name and how big the letters should be is the most important step in the process of ordering boat lettering. Your measurement is how you ensure the boat lettering you order will fit on your boat the way you want it. </p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Some people like their lettering a little larger, some a little smaller. It's really a matter of personal choice. There are, however, some things that will determine the size for you, such as available space and government regulations.The transom is probably the most common place to put your boat lettering. Some transoms have lots of space with very little hardware to get in the way of your lettering. Others are quite small or have many obstacles, such as thru-hulls, bait tanks, doors, lights and fasteners. </p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">For the best results, try not to worry too much about minor hardware, especially that which can be removed prior to installation and later replaced. It is almost always best to center the lettering on the transom rather than placing it off to one side just to avoid a small thru-hull or hardware. Many people ask us about putting lettering over doors. Most sport fishers have a door on their transom and avoiding that door is almost impossible. It is very common to place lettering over the door, as long as it is mostly flush with the transom. Try to avoid placing the lettering over both sides of the door, unless the door is centered on the transom.</p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Those boats that do not have available space on their transoms, such as smaller boats with outboards and sailboats the sides of the boat is the only place to put your lettering. When installing on the side of the boat, the size of the lettering will be determined by your own personal tastes. Some sailboats have their hailing port on the transom while their name is on both sides. This is common and seems acceptable by the USCG. </p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">One way to see what size will look best is to use some masking tape and place a rectangle up where you would like the lettering to be. This way you can step back from the boat and get a better perspective. Once you decide what size looks good to you simply measure the taped area and you will have your lettering size. </p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Remember your boat name is not only a reflection of you and your personality; it is how you identify yourself over the radio in the maritime world so choose your boat name carefully. One suggestion we have is to simply say to yourself, “This is (insert boat name) calling for assistance” if you like how it sounds, then you have a winning name.</p>

                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Now that you have your boat measurements and some idea on colors, it's time to design your boat name. Your first step is to set your capital letter height.</p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>1. Establish your letter height</span><br>
The letter size is driven by the capital letter height. The width of the lettering is auto calculated based on the capital letter height. If you have strict sizing requirements due to limited available space you can tailor your lettering to fit by adjusting the length + or – 20%. If the lettering still does not fit your space try selecting a narrower or wider font style. </p>

								<p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>US. Coast Guard and DMV regulations overview: </span><br>
All markings may be made by any means and materials that result in durable markings and must be at least four inches in height, made in clearly legible letters of the Latin alphabet or Arabic or Roman numerals. The "hailing port" must include a place and a State, Territory, or possession of in the United States. The state may be abbreviated. The letters must be legible and of contrasting color to that of the hull.Most private yachts use a 3-inch letter for hailing ports.

                                        <li>Block fonts, like Arial Bold and AvantGarde are great for a clean and simple boat name. They offer great legibility and are well suited for hailing ports and registration numbers.</li>
                                        <li>Roman letter styles such as Times New Roman Bold are a classic choice  for boat lettering and are great for almost any other application.</li>
                                        <li>Script fonts, like Amazone BT or Commercial Script, while not suited for registration numbers and ports, are very popular for boat names. </li>
                                        <li>Miscellaneous fonts, like Viking, are mostly used for the name of the boat. In general these fonts defy categorizing and are great for a more unique style.</li>

                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>3. Choose your letter color</span><br>
Choosing the best letter color for your boat name begins with noting the colors already on the boat. Many boats will have a boot stripe, pin striping or graphics. Using the same or similar colors for your lettering gives your boat a more polished and complete look. If you’re not crazy about the colors currently on your boat, you can choose colors that are more neutral and less likely to throw off your boats existing color scheme. Black lettering with a gray, silver or gold effect will work with almost any color combination. </p>

								<p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">One way to gain visibility in a low contrast color situation is to use a high contrast outline and/or shadow color. Gold lettering on a white hull may not show up very well, but gold lettering with a black, blue or green outline will show up much better. This also applies to the colors you choose to complement your lettering, such as outline, shadows, or both. If you have black lettering, it is better to choose a color of medium value for an outline or shadow, such as Silver metallic, Gold, Gray, Teal or Olympic blue. For lighter color lettering, a dark color will make it stand out.</p>
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">If you are finding yourself at a loss for ideas on which color to start with, you may find inspiration by browsing our boat name gallery. A few simple rules to help, if you are after maximum visibility you will want to choose a letter color with the highest contrast to the color of the hull. A medium to light gray color against a white hull will not offer a lot of visibility at a distance. At the same time, medium to dark blues or greens will not show up very well against a dark color hull.</p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>4. Type in your boat name</span><br>
When typing in your lettering, be sure to type it in exactly as you would like it to read on the boat. If you want a space, no space or a dash (-) between letters make sure it is typed in that way. Also, make sure you type in the lettering in the desired case, such as UPPER CASE, lower case or Mixed Case.</p>

								<p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>5. Select your letter style shadow effects</span><br>
Shadows can be used to complement a letter's color, or to create dimensionality not seen with single color designs. Using a light to medium gray shadow can give the appearance that the lettering is set away from the surface of the boat giving it a three dimensional effect. Using an outline along with a shadow can offer an even more dramatic effect. If you are working with a colored hull, experiment with different color shadows to see what works best.</p>

								<p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>6. Determine if you want to add a distortion effect</span><br>
Distortion effects add style to ordinary looking lettering; giving it the appearance of movement. For best results, use UPPER CASE Roman or Block style fonts when choosing distortion effects. Click here to see distortion effects http://boatletteringdesign.com/DD_BoatLettering.php?do=view_distortion</p>

								<p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Note: Applying a distortion to your lettering will change the overall size (usually the height) of the lettering. Do not apply a distortion such as arc, arch, top arch, pennant or squeeze if you have a limited vertical area to work with. In general, the overall height of the lettering with any distortion applied will not be more than twice (2 times) the Lettering Height selected.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>7. Decide if you want to incorporate clip art into your design</span><br>
Due to the enormous variety of clip art and possible color combinations, we have limited our clip art selection to the most commonly asked for images and color combinations. After selecting your clip art, choose the size of the graphic (the measured length being the widest part of the graphic) and add to cart. After you select the color, indicate how graphics you want and whether or not you want them to face the same direction or face opposite directions in order to have them both "face" forward on either side of the boat. </p>

								 <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1"><span>8. Need some help?</span><br>
If you are having trouble creating a style that best suits your personality, our lettering presets should serve as inspiration to help you through the design process. Once you choose a desired preset, you will see it’s affect on your boat name, hailing port or registration numbers. Then, you can make further changes to the font style, height and width of the lettering, as well as colors to dial in your desired design. </p>

The preparation of the surface is very important, as vinyl will not adhere well to a surface contaminated with dust, dirt, grease, wax, Teflon or other residue. Use a piece of masking tape to test the surface of the entire work area before applying lettering. When pulling up the tape you want to have at least some resistance. If the tape does not stick, the vinyl will not stick.</p>

                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Should you need to remove existing lettering and/or graphics from your boat, the first step is to determine what you're dealing with. Determine what the lettering is made of and the surface it is applied to. This will help avoid costly errors or even permanent damage to your boat. If you are not sure about compatibility of a particular solvent with the surface, spot test in an inconspicuous area first.</p>
                                
                                <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">If it is vinyl lettering, peel up an edge and pull from surface. A heat gun, hair dryer or in some cases the heat from the sun can helping this process. Sometimes pulling back on itself or at small angle to the surface can help bring the adhesive with the film. Remove excess adhesive with Goof-Off product or other similar adhesive removal solvents. After the lettering is removed, take this opportunity to polish the surface thoroughly, which cannot be done with lettering in place. Power buff the surface with a wax less polishing compound. The compound should also not contain Teflon; Silicones as this can affect the adhesion of the new name.</p>
                                
                               <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">If it is painted lettering that is one-part enamel over a gel coat hull surface, acetone and rubbing compound mixture used with a power buffer can take the lettering off. This will also polish the gel coat at the same time. This method is best when the paint is worn thin. If the paint is newer and thicker it is best to soften the paint with an acetone saturated pad of paper towels first, then while the paint is still soft quickly scrape the paint off with a razor-blade scraper. It is important to round the corners of the razor blade first with sand paper as to not scratch the gel coat. This should take off a majority of the paint. The power buffer will get the small ruminant and polish the surface to a mirror finish.</p>
                               
                               <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">It is best when using compounds to use high-end professional products that do not contain waxes or silicones. The idea is to get a mirror finish without waxes, Teflon, silicones etc. These products are disguising the lack of a true mirror finish. Besides, with these contaminates, the new name won't adhere as well nor last as long. No matter what method used to remove lettering from your boat, protective/safety gear is a must. Gloves must be worn because the solvents can be carcinogenic, cause liver damage, skin damage etc. Keep in mind that rubber gloves will not protect you from acetone, lacquer thinner, MEK, and various other chemicals. The molecules of the solvents are smaller than the mesh of the membrane of the glove and will immediately permeate right through. A 4-H glove or Butyl glove can protect you from the fore mentioned chemicals. A respirator is also strongly recommended.</p>
                               
                               <p class="bodytext-faq marg-topbot1">Another method for removing enamel from gel coat is spraying Easy-Off oven cleaner on the lettering. Mask off any painted or varnished surfaces; also mask the "drip" areas. The oven cleaner will bubble the paint in a few minutes. Before the paint starts to drip, scrape the letter with a razor blade scraper. Wipe off the excess. You will notice this turned the gel coat yellow. Don't panic! Wipe the entire area with distilled vinegar. This will turn the gel coat back to it's original white. Do not use this method on colored gel coats or paint</p>
